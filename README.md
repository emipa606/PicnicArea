Mod that adds a picnic-area for pawns to eat in. 
If they do, they will not get the "Ate without table-debuff"
Inspired by the [Picnic Spot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1528586050) mod by cucumpear

Settings for time of day and temperature
Pawns will not picnic if its bad weather, unless changed in settings
Picnic area needs seating but not tables
If conditions are met and there are regular dining-areas available there is a 50% chance that they will eat at a picnic-area. If there are no available dining-areas they will always try to eat outside, if the conditions are met.
